# Richter's Prediction Notebook
Workflow and Script Interaction

data_preprocessing.py

Purpose: This script is the first step in the workflow. It loads the raw data, performs necessary preprocessing steps (like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalizing or scaling features, etc.), and saves the processed data into a directory for processed files.
Outputs: The preprocessed training and testing datasets, typically saved as CSV files (train_processed.csv and test_processed.csv).
Next Step: The processed files are then used for model training.


train_model.py

Inputs: This script loads the processed training data generated by data_preprocessing.py.
Purpose: It uses this data to train a machine learning model, tuning parameters with RandomizedSearchCV or another similar method to find the optimal model settings.
Outputs: The trained model is saved to disk, typically as a .pkl file using joblib.
Next Step: The trained model file is used to make predictions on new or test data.


predict_model.py

Inputs: It loads the trained model from the file saved by train_model.py and the processed test data (which might also be preprocessed by data_preprocessing.py if it involves a separate test dataset).
Purpose: The script uses the loaded model to make predictions on the test data.
Outputs: The predictions are then formatted as required (e.g., for a competition submission or a report) and saved to a CSV file in the submission directory.
